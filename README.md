# PortableGallery
Application uses basic html, javascript, and css.
Currently the only way to view pages its by using localhost in an IDE like WebStorm
Our pages our complete for each of the 5 user tasks, while lacking some navigation between the pages.
RegistrationLogin.html is the Login/Register Task
Main Viewing Page.html are the pages for the Art Viewing Task
testArtist1.html is the main artist page and commission.html and subscription.html are the Commission and Subscription Tasks
ProfilePage.html, EditProfilePage.html, and AddImagePage.html are all for the User Profile Task
